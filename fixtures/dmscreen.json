You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.\r\n\r\n**Help**\r\nYou help one creature with a task giving that creature advantage on the next ability check it makes for that task. Or you distract one creature within 5 feet of you, and the next attack roll that an ally of yours makes against that creature has advantage.\r\nWhichever option you choose, the advantage goes away once used or when your next turn starts.\r\n\r\n**Hide**\r\nYou make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to become hidden--unseen and unheard.\r\n\r\n**Ready**\r\nYou wait for a particular circumstance before you act, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn. You must decide in advance (a) what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction and (b) the action you will take in response to that trigger.\r\nIf you ready a spell, it must have a casting time of 1 action, and you must concentrate on it until you release it.\r\n\r\n**Search**\r\nYou make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find something.\r\n\r\n**Use a Magic Item**\r\nYou use a magic item that requires your action for its use.\r\n\r\n**Use an Object**\r\nYou use an object, other than a magic item, that requires your action for its use.\r\n\r\n**Use a Special Ability**\r\nYou use a class feature or other special ability that requires your action for its use.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Long Jump**\r\nMove 10+ feet, and jump a number of feet up to your Strength score. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance.\r\n\r\n**High Jump**\r\nMove 10+ feet, and jump a number of feet up to 3 + your Strength modifier. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance.\r\n\r\n**Suffocating**\r\nYou can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).\r\nIf you run out of breath or you're choking, you can survive for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of your next turn, you drop to 0 hit points and are dying, and you can't regain hit points or be stabilized until you can breathe again.\r\n\r\n**Concentration**\r\nIf a spell must be maintained with concentration, its description specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required). The following factors can break your concentration:\r\n- You cast another spell that requires concentration.\r\n- You take damage. Succeed on a Constitution saving throw equal to 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher.\r\n- You're incapacitated or killed.\r\n- You're overwhelmed by an enormous distraction, such as a wave crashing into you. Succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration."
